# My Portfolio

For this project, I created my own portfolio from scratch. My portfolio includes an intro section with webpage navigation links,
a section showcasing my work in the course so far, a bio section, and a contact section. The webpage is responsive to different window and screen sizes.

## Intro Section

In the intro section, you can see a large image of me in the North Carolina mountains. You will also see nav links that are all functional. They also react to the mouse hovering, and change colors to tell you to click there!

## My Work Section

Here you can see images of my first and second applications. I will add more to this as I create more applications throughout the bootcamp. The first application I created is larger than the second. Both images also react to hovering to show a title of the webpage and the coding skills used in each one. Both images are fully clickable anywhere in the image to take you to the deployed application in a new tab. 

## Flexing

The portfolio flexes to adapt to different viewports and window sizes, to give any visitor to the webpage the best experience possible regardless of device or window/screen size. I used flex wrap for the images in the my work section so they will wrap vertically. 

## Media Queries

To further insure the webpage looks its absolute best on any screen, I used media queries in the stylesheet to change the size of some of the text on the webpage, mainly to make some of the p and h1 elements more readable at different sizes.
